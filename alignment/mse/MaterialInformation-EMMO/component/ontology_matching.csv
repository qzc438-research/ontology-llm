According to Charles Sanders Peirce's semiotic theory, a 'Sign' can be categorized into three subtypes:

1. **Symbols**: These are signs that stand for an object through convention or agreed-upon rules. For example, chemical symbols like ""H"" for hydrogen or ""O"" for oxygen are symbols in materials science.

2. **Indices**: These are signs that stand for an object due to a direct causal relationship or contiguity. For instance, the presence of rust on iron is an index that indicates oxidation.

3. **Icons**: These are signs that represent an object due to resemblance or similarity in shape, structure, or composition. For example, a diagram of a crystal lattice structure is an icon because it visually resembles the actual arrangement of atoms in the material.

A 'Sign' can have temporal-direct-parts, meaning that it can be broken down into smaller signs that also carry meaning. However, at a certain elementary semiotic level, the parts of a 'Sign' become purely 'Physical' and no longer represent anything beyond their physical existence. This elementary level is specific to each system of signs, such as text or painting.

In materials science, just as there are fundamental physical elements (like atoms) in the 'Physical' branch, each 'Sign' branch should have an a-tomistic mereological part, which is the most basic unit that still retains semiotic significance.","Sure, here are the triples verbalised into phrases:

According to this theory, a semiotic process involves three key elements:

1. **Sign (A)**: This is something that represents or stands for something else. In materials science, this could be a symbol, a name, or any other form of representation used to denote a material or a property of a material.

2. **Interpretant (B)**: This is the mental concept or understanding that the sign (A) generates in the mind of the interpreter. For example, when a scientist sees a specific symbol or name, they form a mental concept of the material or property that the sign represents.

3. **Object (C)**: This is the actual entity or material that the sign (A) and the interpretant (B) refer to. It is the real-world counterpart that the sign is meant to denote.

Additionally, the **interpreter** is the entity (e.g., a scientist or engineer) that connects the sign to the object, facilitating the understanding and communication of material properties or identities.

In summary, within materials science, semiotics involves the use of signs to represent materials or their properties, the interpretation of these signs by scientists or engineers, and the actual materials or properties being referred to.

Similarly, in a coating application, the coating material has contact with the substrate, impacting adhesion and protective qualities.",Information is not available.

This can occur at various scales, from atomic to macroscopic levels. For example, in a composite material, if the reinforcing fibers are not well-bonded to the matrix, they are considered disconnected, which can negatively impact the material's mechanical properties. Similarly, in a network of grains in a polycrystalline material, if the grains are not well-connected, it can affect the material's overall strength and conductivity.",Information is not available.

Given that enclosure is reflexive and transitive, this means that a material can enclose itself (reflexive property) and if one material encloses a second material, and the second material encloses a third, then the first material also encloses the third (transitive property). This concept is important in understanding how different materials interact and are contained within various structures or systems.",Information is not available.

This means that the part is a distinct and separate entity within the larger structure. For example, in a composite material, the fibers could be considered proper parts of the composite matrix. The term emphasizes that the part is a proper subset of the whole, contributing to its overall properties and functionality.",Information is not available.

This term can be used in various scenarios, such as in the study of composite materials, where fibers or strands may intersect and cross over each other, or in the analysis of polymer networks where polymer chains may cross over one another. These overcrossing points can significantly influence the mechanical properties, strength, and behavior of the material.",Information is not available.

For example, if two different materials exhibit similar thermal expansion properties within a certain temperature range, one could say that their thermal expansion behaviors ""have overlap."" This term can also be used in computational materials science to describe the intersection of data sets, such as overlapping ranges of stress-strain curves, electronic band structures, or other material characteristics.",Information is not available.

The EMMO is a structured framework that provides a standardized way to describe and categorize materials, their properties, and the processes they undergo. 

An ""EMMORelation"" is a formalized connection or association between different entities (such as materials, properties, or processes) within this ontology. These relationships help in organizing and linking various concepts in a coherent manner, facilitating better understanding, communication, and data interoperability in the field of materials science.","The subject ""EMMORelation"" has a domain of ""EMMO"" and a range of ""EMMO""."

This means that the material or system can be broken down into parts that exist in specific locations and at specific times. For example, a composite material might have different phases or structures that evolve over time and are distributed in various regions of the material. Understanding these spatiotemporal parts is crucial for analyzing the behavior, properties, and performance of the material over time and space.","The property ""hasSpatioTemporalPart"" has a domain of ""Item"" and a range of ""Item""."

This means that the material or object can be analyzed or described in terms of its various states, properties, or conditions at different points in time. For example, a metal undergoing a heat treatment process may have different temporal parts corresponding to its state before heating, during heating, and after cooling. Each of these temporal parts can have distinct characteristics and behaviors that are relevant to the study and application of the material.","The property ""hasTemporalPart"" has a domain of ""Item"" and a range of ""Item""."

This term is used to describe how different parts of a material or structure are organized and related to each other in space. For example, in a composite material, the matrix and the reinforcement fibers can be described as having spatial parts of the overall composite structure.","The property ""hasSpatialPart"" is defined with the following characteristics:
- The domain of ""hasSpatialPart"" is ""Item"", meaning that ""hasSpatialPart"" is a property that applies to instances of ""Item"".
- The range of ""hasSpatialPart"" is also ""Item"", indicating that the value or target of the ""hasSpatialPart"" property is also an instance of ""Item"".

In simpler terms, ""hasSpatialPart"" is a property that relates one ""Item"" to another ""Item""."
