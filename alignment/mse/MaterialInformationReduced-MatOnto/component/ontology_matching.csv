http://codata.jp/OML-MaterialInformation-reduced#CarburizingAndNitrizing,Source,Class,carburizing and nitrizing,"In materials science, carburizing and nitriding are two surface hardening processes used to enhance the properties of metals, particularly steel.

1. **Carburizing**: This is a heat treatment process in which carbon is introduced into the surface layer of a steel part. The process involves heating the steel in a carbon-rich environment (such as in the presence of a carbon-containing gas or solid) at high temperatures, typically between 900°C and 950°C. The carbon diffuses into the surface, creating a high-carbon outer layer while the core remains low-carbon. This results in a hard, wear-resistant surface with a tough, ductile core, improving the overall durability and fatigue resistance of the part.

2. **Nitriding**: This is another surface hardening process where nitrogen is introduced into the surface of a steel part. Unlike carburizing, nitriding is usually performed at lower temperatures, typically between 500°C and 550°C. The process involves exposing the steel to a nitrogen-rich environment, such as ammonia gas. The nitrogen diffuses into the surface, forming hard nitrides with alloying elements in the steel. This creates a very hard, wear-resistant surface layer without the need for quenching, which can reduce the risk of distortion and cracking.

Both processes are used to improve the wear resistance, fatigue strength, and surface hardness of steel components, making them suitable for demanding applications such as gears, crankshafts, and other high-stress mechanical parts.","Sure, here are the triples verbalized into phrases:
