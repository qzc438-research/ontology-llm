1. **Carburizing**:
   - **Definition**: Carburizing is a heat treatment process in which a metal, usually low-carbon steel, is exposed to a carbon-rich environment at high temperatures. This allows carbon atoms to diffuse into the surface layer of the metal.
   - **Purpose**: The primary goal is to increase the carbon content on the surface, creating a hard, wear-resistant outer layer while maintaining a tougher, more ductile core.
   - **Process**: The metal is heated in the presence of a carbonaceous material (such as charcoal or carbon monoxide gas) at temperatures typically between 850°C and 950°C. After carburizing, the metal is usually quenched to lock in the hard surface structure.

2. **Nitrizing**:
   - **Definition**: Nitrizing is a heat treatment process that introduces nitrogen into the surface of a metal, typically steel, to form hard nitrides.
   - **Purpose**: The aim is to create a hard, wear-resistant surface layer that also has good fatigue and corrosion resistance.
   - **Process**: The metal is heated in an atmosphere of ammonia gas (NH₃) or a nitrogen-rich environment at temperatures usually between 500°C and 550°C. Unlike carburizing, nitrizing does not require quenching, as the process itself creates a hard surface layer.
